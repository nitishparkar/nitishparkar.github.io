'Hello World' : two words that initiated me into the amazing world of programming. So I thought it would be apt to start my blog with these two words. I always wanted to own a blog. So after much deliberation and two failed attempts finally I have (third) one! I intend to post on Linux, Programming and anything related to technology. In addition I might also post non-technical stuff that I find interesting. Thats it for now, will post something as soon as possible.
