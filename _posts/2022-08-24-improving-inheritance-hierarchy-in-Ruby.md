title: "Improving inheritance hierarchy in Ruby"
---

Classical inheritance is one of the most common code-sharing techniques. Every CS graduate knows it. It's also easier to shoot yourself into the foot while implementing it and making the code harder to modify and reuse. I was recently going through [Practical Object-Oriented Design, An Agile Primer Using Ruby](https://www.poodr.com/) which discusses it in depth. I'll explain a few techniques I learned from the book that are easy to put into practice.

Consider this somewhat contrived example:
```ruby
class Animal
  def eat
    'Eating...'
  end

  def characteristics
    [:legs, :tail]
  end
end


class Dog < Animal
  def speak
    'Woof!'
  end
end

class Cow < Animal
  def speak
    'Moo!'
  end

  def characteristics
    super + [:horns]
  end
end
```
`Animal` is an abstract superclass; `Cow` and `Dog` are concrete subclasses. Each subclass of `Animal` implements its version of `speak`. Subclasses can add additional characteristics that are specific to them.   

## Template method pattern

`Animal` imposes a requirement upon its subclasses that is not obvious by looking at it - every subclass must implement `speak`. To improve this, the superclass - `Animal` must provide an implementation for every message it expects as part of the common contract. Even if the only reasonable implementation is raising an exception. 

```ruby
class Animal
  # ...

  def speak
    raise NotImplementedError
  end
end
```

## Hook Messages

Subclasses of `Animal` can add characteristics that are specific to that animal by appending them to `Animal#characteristics`. Thus all the subclasses need to be aware of the algorithm to add subclass-specific characteristics. If that algorithm changes, all subclasses will have to be updated even though their specializations are not affected. Also, if a subclass forgets to call super, the resulting characteristics are wrong and this wrongness may not be apparent immediately since nothing breaks. This can be fixed using hook messages.

```ruby
class Animal
  # ...

  def characteristics
    [:legs, :tail] + additional_characteristics
  end

  def additional_characteristics
    []
  end
end

class Cow < Animal
  # ...

  def additional_characteristics
    [:horns]
  end
end
```


## Testing Inheritance Code

The first goal of testing is to prove that all objects in this hierarchy honor their contract. **The Liskov Substitution Principle** declares that subtypes should be substitutable for their supertypes. Violations of Liskov result in unreliable objects that donâ€™t behave as expected. The easiest way to prove that every object in the hierarchy obeys Liskov is to write a shared test for the common contract and include this test in every object.


```ruby
module AnimalInterfaceTest
  def test_responds_to_eat
    assert_respond_to(@object, :eat)
  end

  def test_responds_to_speak
    assert_respond_to(@object, :speak)
  end

  def test_responds_to_characteristics
    assert_respond_to(@object, :characteristics)
  end
end


class AnimalTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  include AnimalInterfaceTest

  def setup
    @object = Animal.new
  end
end

class DogTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  include AnimalInterfaceTest

  def setup
    @object = Dog.new
  end
end

class CowTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  include AnimalInterfaceTest

  def setup
    @object = Cow.new
  end
end
```
<br/>

Because there are many subclasses, they should share a common test to prove that each meets the requirements:
```ruby
module AnimalSubclassTest
  def test_responds_to_additional_characteristics
    assert_respond_to(@object, :additional_characteristics)
  end

  def test_responds_to_speak
    assert_respond_to(@object, :speak)
  end
end

class DogTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  include AnimalInterfaceTest
  include AnimalSubclassTest

  # ...
end

class CowTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  include AnimalInterfaceTest
  include AnimalSubclassTest

  # ...
end
```
<br/>

In addition to the interface tests, we should test behaviours that are specific to superclass and subclasses in their respective tests:
```ruby
class AnimalTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  # ...

  def setup
    @animal = @object = Animal.new
  end

  def test_forces_subclasses_to_implement_speak
    assert_raises(NotImplementedError) { @animal.speak }
  end
end


class CowTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  # ...

  def setup
    @cow = @object = Cow.new
  end

  def test_adds_additional_characteristics
    assert_includes @cow.characteristics, :horns
  end
end
```

That's all for this post. This is a small subset of all the inheritance-related things covered in the book. Do read [the book](https://www.poodr.com/) to understand inheritance and other OO design techniques in depth; and take your Ruby OO chops to the next level.
