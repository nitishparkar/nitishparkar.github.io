We all have played  [Hangman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) at some point of time in our lives. This is a basic implementation of Hangman game in Java using Canvas. In this implementation, the word to guess is chosen randomly from a file. Hangman diagram is represented by a series of images. Each time player makes a false guess a new image is loaded containing one more element of the hangman than in the previous image. Images are loaded using Java Image I/O API. Rest of the logic can be understood by reading the code and comments. I have uploaded [the source file](http://pastebin.com/WkUx4fLQ) on pastebin.
