title: "Cows and Bulls in Java"
---

A basic implementation of [Cows and Bulls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows) game in Java. In this program I have used [Absolute Positioning](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/none.html) concept (No specific reason for using absolute positioning, just wanted to try it). JTable is used to display entered words and score (number of cows and bulls).
